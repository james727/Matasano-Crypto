# Solutions to the Matasano Cryptography challenges
Status as of 9/30/2016:
- [x] Set 1
- [x] Set 2
- [x] Set 3
- [x] Set 4
- [x] Set 5
- [x] Set 6
- [x] Set 7
- [ ] Set 8

The solutions are in folders by set; it should be relatively straightforward from there.

As of 9/30 I'll no longer be committing to this repository. I've completed the first 7 sets, and while I'll continue to work on the 8th, I won't be posting my solutions here until the creators make the 8th set public.
